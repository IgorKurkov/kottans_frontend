 - I was refreshed information from last girl's course about Git, and first course was much interesting and deeper for me, but this one had more practice and fun. 
 - I understand --amend, references, upstream, got good things about "backup" branches, and saw rebase in action. 
 - I will use most of all these commands on practice. I think the deeper understanding will come on practice.
